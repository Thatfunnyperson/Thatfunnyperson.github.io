        <!-- GAME DESCRIPTION -->
        Corporate Ladder is a satirical climb through office absurdity, blending puzzle mechanics with narrative twists. You play as a quirky CEO navigating bizarre departments, solving logic-based challenges, and uncovering the secrets of corporate culture. The game was born from a jam idea and evolved through iterative level design, character scripting, and playful UI experiments.

      <h3>Development Process</h3>
      <p class="game-text">
        <!-- PROCESS DESCRIPTION-->
        The project began with a sketch of a vertical maze, inspired by old-school platformers and modern workplace humor. I prototyped mechanics in Blueprint, layered in environmental storytelling, and refined the pacing through playtests. The final build includes animated elevators, dynamic dialogue, and a custom shader for fluorescent lighting effects.
